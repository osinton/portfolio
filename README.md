# Personal Portfolio Website

The deployed and working website can be found here: https://osinton.github.io/portfolio/

## Project Description

I built this website to showcase my work as well as learning more about building websites and using new coding languages for me. The website is a static build made with HTML and Bootstrap framework elements, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is fully responsive to screen size and can be used on any device.

## What did I learn?

I had never built a full website before starting this project, and there sure was a learning curve while working on this project. At the start I didn’t quite understand how the syntax worked or how certain features would be able to achieve, but by the end of this project I can say that I am quite comfortable with HTML and CSS in projects. Through this project I learned how these languages work and how I can achieve the look I am going for in a website.
